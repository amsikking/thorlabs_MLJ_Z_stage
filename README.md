# thorlabs_MLJ_Z_stage
Python device adaptor: Dual synchronized Thorlabs MLJ motorized high-load vertical translation stages, 50 mm travel
## Details:
- A basic device adaptor and GUI for controlling 2 Thorlabs MLJ motorized high-load vertical translation stages in a synchronized way (currently supports MLJ050 and MLJ150 models).
- This can provide a flexible and stable solution for moving ~40Kg (~88lb) over a 50mm range to a positional tolerance of about +-10um.
- Some benefits of this setup are:
  - the stages can hold their position without power
  - the simple breadboard interface can be combined with a variety of mechanics to produce Z stages for different applications.
  - the relatively low cost.
